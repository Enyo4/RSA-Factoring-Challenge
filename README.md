From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The RSA Factoring Challenge was a challenge put forward by RSA Laboratories on March 18, 1991[1] to encourage research into computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large integers and cracking RSA keys used in cryptography.

The challenge os to create two random prime numbers
Output format: n=p*q
where p and q are prine numbers
